Normal water pressure for a domestic water supply is between 45 to 60 pounds per square inch (psi). Water pressure over 60 psi can cause troubles for your plumbing system and fixtures including pipe bursts. Therefore you need to be careful about the water pressure in your house. If you observe the flow through an opened water tap, you can easily notice low water pressure and high water pressure that is not normal. But to measure the water pressure accurately you need to use a pressure gauge that can be screwed to the hose bibb.

## what causes low water pressure in the whole house?

if you noticed low water pressure in the whole house all of a sudden, it could be due to a problem in the main supply line.
This could be caused by,

​	01. Clogged mainline

​	02. Damaged mainline

​	03. Breakdown or problem in the city water main.

​	04. Frozen or freezing pipes.

If you find a sudden pressure drop in each and every fixture in your house there is a high possibility of having a fault in the city water main. But first, verify that the main shutoff valve is open. Then check the water meter to detect if there is any unusual flow reading.
If there is any damage occurred to the main water line, water could be leaking and hence a huge pressure drop can occur.

If possible, you could verify by checking with neighbours whether they also face the same issue. If the pressure drop caused is due to breakdown in the city water main, that should affect to the neighbouring houses also. You can verify this by calling the service hotline.

If you live in a cold-weather region especially if you experience subzero temperatures, water pressure can be dropped due to frozen or freezing pipes. This is a very serious problem as if you do not act quickly enough pipes can burst. This is due to the fact the water volume expands when it freezes. Frozen pipes occur mostly in late December to early February when the winter season comes.
