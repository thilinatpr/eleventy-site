Normal water pressure for a domestic water supply is between 45 to 60 pounds per square inch (psi). Water pressure over 60 psi can cause troubles for your plumbing system and fixtures including pipe bursts. Therefore you need to be carefull about the water pressure in your house. If you observe the flow through an opened water tap, you can easily notice low water pressure and high water pressure that is not normal. But to measure the the water pressure accuraretly you need to use a pressure guage which can be screwed to the hose bibb.

## what causes low water pressure in the whole house?

if you noticed low water pressure in whole house all of a sudden, it could be due to problem in main supply line.
This could caused by,
- Clogged main line
- Damaged main line
- Breakdown or problem in city water main.
- Frozen or freezing pipes.

If you find a sudden pressure drop in each and every fixture in your house there is high possibility of having a issue city water main. But first verify that the main shutoff valve is open. Then check the water meter to detect if there is any unusual flow reading.
If there is any damage occured to the main water line might be leaking and hence a huge drop in water pressure can occure.

If possible, you could verify by cheking with neighbours whether they also face the same issue. If the pressure drop caused is due to breakdown in city water main, that should affect to the neighboring houses also. You can verify this by calling the service hotline.

If you live in a cold weather regions specially if you experience subzero temperatures, water pressure can be droped due to frozen or freezing pipes. This is very serious problem as if you do not act quickly enough pipes can burst. This is due to fact the water volume expands when it freezes. Frozen pipes occurs mostly in late December to early February when the winter season comes.
