Your water meter keeps track of how much water your household uses. The meter is usually located along the sidewalk, in front of your home, inside a concrete box with a concrete cover marked “WATER METER.” or "WATER"

. In some homes the water meter is located in the basement. It may be a bit dark inside th4meter box, so bring a flashlight along!

Meters measure water either in cubic feet or gallons. One cubic foot equals 7.48 gallons. For example,if your meter says you used 41 cubic feet in a day, you would multiply 41 by 7.48 to find out that over 306 gallons were used that day. Utilities with meters bill by the “unit,”normally, such units are measured as 100 cubic feet (748 gallons) or alternatively, 1,000 gallons.

You can check for leaks on individually metered residences by using your meter. Make certain that no water is being used on the property.Then open the cap of your water meter. Note the location of the dial test hand. Don’t run water for 30 minutes. If the dial has moved, you’ve got a leak. Read on to determine the possible cause.
